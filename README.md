## Part 1: Getting Started with ZK Mathematics

Build a solid foundation in the mathematics behind ZK with these resources:

1. **ZK Book**  
   _URL:_ [https://rareskills.io/zk-book](https://rareskills.io/zk-book)  
   _Why:_ This is the best resource to start as a beginner in Zero-Knowledge proofs.

2. **Moon-Math Manual**  
   _URL:_ [https://rb.gy/et58js](https://rb.gy/et58js)  
   _Why:_ After the ZK Book, I moved on to reading the Moon-Math manual and solving its exercises. It gets easier if you have already gone through the ZK Book.

3. **Abstract Algebra Resource**  
   _URL:_ [http://abstract.ups.edu](http://abstract.ups.edu)  
   _Why:_ For an in-depth study of Abstract Algebra, which is crucial for understanding the underlying math in ZK.

## Part 2: Deep Diving into ZK Protocols

Once you have the mathematical background, these resources will help you explore various protocols and practical applications:

1. **ZKP-MOOC Series**  
   _URL:_ [https://zk-learning.org](https://zk-learning.org)  
   _Why:_ A comprehensive series that covers different ZK protocols, including sessions on writing circuits.

2. **Justin Thaler's "Proof, Args, and ZK"**  
   _URL:_ [https://rb.gy/x786jz](https://rb.gy/x786jz)  
   _Why:_ This book is excellent for learning everything from the ground up. I thoroughly enjoyed it!

3. **ZK-Whiteboard Sessions**  
   _URL:_ [https://rb.gy/ulkrnt](https://rb.gy/ulkrnt)  
   _Why:_ Learn directly from professionals through these whiteboard sessions, which break down complex concepts in an accessible way.

## Additional Resources

Beyond the main tracks, here are some extra materials that have broadened my understanding of cryptography and its real-world applications:

1. **Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography**  
   _URL:_ [https://toc.cryptobook.us](https://toc.cryptobook.us)  
   _Why:_ This course by Dan Boneh is math-heavy and provides a thorough grounding in cryptography in general. (I'm still reading this one!)

2. **Real-world Cryptography**  
   _By:_ [@cryptodavidw](https://twitter.com/cryptodavidw)  
   _Why:_ Offers exposure to real-life use cases of cryptography without requiring an in-depth understanding of all the underlying math.

3. **Book List Tweet by @portport255**  
   _URL:_ [https://rb.gy/72sybw](https://rb.gy/72sybw)  
   _Why:_ A bookmarked tweet that lists all the essential books in one place—an amazing guide for anyone building their cryptography library.
